# Brain-Tumor-Classification-TeachableMachine
Brain tumor classification using MRI images with four categories (No Tumor, Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary) trained via Teachable Machine and deployed in Python using Anaconda and Visual Studio.

# ðŸ§  Understanding Brain Tumors
Glioma: A tumor that arises from glial cells in the brain. They can be aggressive and require early detection.

Meningioma: A typically benign tumor that forms on membranes covering the brain and spinal cord.

Pituitary Tumor: Tumors that occur in the pituitary gland, affecting hormone levels.

No Tumor: Normal brain MRI with no tumor present.

MRI imaging is a critical tool in the diagnosis of these conditions. This model helps in automating initial detection to assist radiologists.

# ðŸ“Š Dataset Summary
The MRI brain tumor dataset used for training contains a total of 5,712 images, categorized into the following four classes:

| Tumor Type       | Number of Images |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| No Tumor         | 1,595            |
| Glioma Tumor     | 1,321            |
| Meningioma Tumor | 1,339            |
| Pituitary Tumor  | 1,457            |

These images were preprocessed and labeled before being used in training via Teachable Machine.

The dataset used for training was obtained from Kaggle:

# ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The goal of this project is to:

- capable model of accurately detecting and classifying different types of brain tumors from MRI images.

- Make it easy to deploy and run the model using Python in a local environment.

- Provide an intuitive way to analyze medical image data with minimal setup.

# ðŸ§© Custom Enhancements
In addition to using the standard exported code from Teachable Machine, I added extra functionality to improve the output experience:

âœ… Display the uploaded MRI image

âœ… Show the predicted tumor type

âœ… Print the prediction confidence 

This enhancement allows for quick visual feedback on the input image and helps in interpreting the model's predictions more clearly.
